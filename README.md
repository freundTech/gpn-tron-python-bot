gpn-tron
========

A small python bot for  [gpn-tron](https://github.com/freehuntx/gpn-tron).
See the protocol documentation [here](https://github.com/freehuntx/gpn-tron/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md).

Powered by python, asyncio and numpy. The strategy quite simple, but still got a decent amount of wins, placing 5-10 in
the top 10 list multiple times.
